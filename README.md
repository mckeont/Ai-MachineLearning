Step 1: Download and Install Ollama
Go to the official website: ollama.com

Click the "Download" button and select "Download for Windows".

Run the .exe installer you just downloaded. It's a standard installation; just click "Next" and "Install".

That's it. Ollama is now installed and running as a background service on your computer. You'll see a small llama icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner of your screen). It will automatically detect and use your NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU.
