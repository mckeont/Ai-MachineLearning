Notes on Ai and Machine Learning

Step 1: Download and Install Ollama
Go to the official website: ollama.com

Click the "Download" button and select "Download for Windows".

Run the .exe installer you just downloaded. It's a standard installation; just click "Next" and "Install".

That's it. Ollama is now installed and running as a background service on your computer. You'll see a small llama icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner of your screen). It will automatically detect and use your NVIDIA RTX 4070 GPU.

Step 2: Open Your Terminal
You will interact with Ollama using the command line. Don't worry, the commands are very simple.

Click the Start Menu.

Type cmd or PowerShell.

Press Enter to open the Command Prompt (the black window).

Step 3: Download and Run Your First Model
Based on your 8GB of VRAM, the perfect first model is Llama 3 (8B). It's smart, fast, and will fit perfectly on your GPU.

In the terminal window, type the following command and press Enter:

Bash

ollama run llama3:8b
Wait. The first time you run this, Ollama will download the model file (it's about 4.7 GB). You'll see a progress bar.

Once it's finished downloading, the prompt in your terminal will change to:

>>> Send a message...
You are now chatting with your own personal, 100% private AI. Type anything you want and press Enter. It will generate a response right there in your terminal.

To exit the chat, just type /bye and press Enter.

Step 4: What to Do Next
Now that the hard part is over, here are a few other simple commands and your next steps.

Useful Commands
Chat with a model you've already downloaded: ollama run llama3:8b (It will be instant this time, no download)

See a list of all models you have installed: ollama list

Download another model (without chatting immediately): ollama pull mistral (This is another great, fast model for your 8GB card)

Delete a model you no longer want: ollama rm mistral

Next Level: A "ChatGPT" Interface (Recommended)
Running in the terminal is cool, but a real chat interface is better. Now that your Ollama "engine" is running, you can connect a "body" to it.

The best one to start with is Open WebUI.

Install Open WebUI: The easiest way is with Docker, but a simple pip install (a Python command) can also work. (A good guide can be found by searching "how to install Open WebUI on Windows").

Run it: Once you run Open WebUI, it will open in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Connect: It will automatically detect your running Ollama service.

You will now have a beautiful, web-based interface just like ChatGPT, but it's powered entirely by your own computer and your downloaded models. This interface also lets you upload documents (PDFs, etc.) to chat with, which accomplishes the personalization step we discussed.
